## Practical Arbitrage Example

Consider a soccer match between **Team X** and **Team Y**. Two different bookmakers offer the following odds:

| Bookmaker   | Team X to win | Team Y to win |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A**       | 2.20          | 1.85          |
| **B**       | 1.75          | 2.10          |

Sharper-Bets’ Arbitrage Scanner identifies this discrepancy and calculates optimal stakes to secure guaranteed profits.

### Step-by-step Calculation

1. **Identify the highest odds available:**
   - Team X at Bookmaker A: **2.20**
   - Team Y at Bookmaker B: **2.10**

2. **Calculate Arbitrage Percentage**
   ```text
   Arb % = (1/2.20 + 1/2.10) × 100
         = 45.45% + 47.62%
         = 93.07%
## Determine Optimal Stakes (for a total investment of €100)

```text
StakeX = (100 / 2.20) × (Arb% / 100)
       ≈ €48.84

StakeY = (100 / 2.10) × (Arb% / 100)
       ≈ €51.16
Guaranteed Profit Calculation

If Team X wins:

€48.84 × 2.20 = €107.45

If Team Y wins:

€51.16 × 2.10 = €107.44

Regardless of which team wins, your €100 investment guarantees around €7.44 in profit.

Sharper-Bets’ Arbitrage Scanner simplifies and automates these calculations, ensuring you always capitalize on profitable arbitrage opportunities quickly and accurately.
